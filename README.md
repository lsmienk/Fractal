## <b> Fractal </b><br>
This project is meant to create graphically beautiful fractals.

## <b> Introduction: </b><br>
The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974,
he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar
pattern whatever the scale. This project shows the Mandelbrot Julia Burningship and Tricorn fractal. 

## <b> General Considerations: </b><br>
- This is an assignment that I made at Codam(42 Network). The pdf of the assignment can be found in this repository.
- The Library that is used is also made by me. This project can also be found on my github page. 

Make file commands: 
```
make
make re
make clean
make fclean
```

- Usage:
```
./fractol [ valid_fractal]

```
options: julia, mandelbrot, burningship, tricorn

<b>Controls: </b>

Change fractol : F <br>
Change colour : C <br>
Zoom : Mouse wheel <br>
Move: Arrows <br>
Reset : R <br>
Change itaration : +/- <br>
Freeze mouse : space <br>

The Julia fractol changes when you move your mouse. <br>
You can use your space bar to freeze it at a certain position and explore the fractal further. <br>
